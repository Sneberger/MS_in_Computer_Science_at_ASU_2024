Grade: A

The School of Computing and Augmented Decisionmaking (SCAI) allowed me to take this class as one of my two allowed 400-level elective classes.

Students in this class chose one of two options: take a final at the end of the class; or write a 7,500 word paper on an approved topic.

I wrote a paper on a topic I approved which after some editing was published as:

  Michael R. Sneberger, Reconciling Competing Data Security Standards Applicable to Data Held by Retail
  Banks Operating in California in Light of Van Buren and TransUnion, 2 Global Privacy Law Review 174 (2021)
