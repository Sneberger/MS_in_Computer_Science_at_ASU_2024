This class was effectively a large gorup project where the class (which included students from disciplines other than Computer Science) created plans on how to assists members of the local community who suffere from dementia.
All work for the class was done on group-managed Google platforms and is not available to post here. My particular contribution involved interviewing a probate attorney who has expertise regarding how people with various forms of dementia are treated by the legal system in the State of Arizona which went to informing the project.
